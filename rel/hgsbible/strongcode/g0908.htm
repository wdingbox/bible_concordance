 1) immersion, submersion
    1a) of calamities and afflictions with which one is quite overwhelmed
    1b) of John's baptism, that purification rite by which men on
        confessing their sins were bound to spiritual reformation,
        obtained the pardon of their past sins and became qualified
        for the benefits of the Messiah's kingdom soon to be set up.
        This was valid Christian baptism, as this was the only baptism
        the apostles received and it is not recorded anywhere that
        they were ever rebaptised after Pentecost.
    1c) of Christian baptism; a rite of immersion in water as
        commanded by Christ, by which one after confessing his sins
        and professing his faith in Christ, having been born again by
        the Holy Spirit unto a new life, identifies publicly with the
        fellowship of Christ and the church.

 In Rom. 6:3 Paul states we are "baptised unto death" meaning that we
 are not only dead to our former ways, but they are buried. To return
 to them is as unthinkable for a Christian as for one to dig up a dead
 corpse! In Moslem countries a new believer has little trouble with
 Moslems until he is publicly baptised. It is then, that the Moslems'
 know he means business, and then the persecution starts. See also
