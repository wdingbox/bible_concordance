 Areopagus = "martial peak"
 1) a rocky height in the city of Athens, opposite the western end
    of the Acropolis toward the west.

 This hill belonged to (Ares) Mars and was called Mar's Hill; so
 called, because, as the story went, Mars, having slain Halirrhothius,
 son of Neptune, for the attempted violation of his daughter Alicippe,
 was tried for the murder here before twelve gods as judges. This
 place was the location where the judges convened who, by appointment
 of Solon, had jurisdiction of capital offences, (as wilful murder,
 arson, poisoning, malicious wounding, and breach of established
 religious usages). The court itself was called Areopagus from the
 place where it sat, also "Areum judicium" an "curia". To that hill
 the apostle Paul was not led to defend himself before judges, but
 that he might set forth his opinions on divine subjects to a greater
 multitude of people, flocking together there and eager to hear
 something new.
