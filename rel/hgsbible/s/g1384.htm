 In the ancient world there was no banking system as we know it
 today, and no paper money. All money was made from metal, heated
 until liquid, poured into moulds and allowed to cool. When the coins
 were cooled, it was necessary to smooth off the uneven edges. The
 coins were comparatively soft and of course many people shaved them
 closely. In one century, more than eighty laws were passed in
 Athens, to stop the practice of shaving down the coins then in
 circulation. But some money changers were men of integrity, who
 would accept no counterfeit money. They were men of honour who put
 only genuine full weighted money into circulation. Such men were
 called "dokimos" or "approved".  Donald Barnhouse
