 1) the construction of a tabernacle or tabernacles
 2) the feast of tabernacles; this festival was observed by the Jews
    yearly for seven days, beginning with the 15th of the month Tisri
    (approx. our Oct.) partly to perpetuate the memory of the time
    when their ancestors after leaving Egypt dwelt in tents on their
    way through the Arabian desert, and partly as a season of
    festivity and joy on the completion of the harvest and the vintage
    (the festival of ingatherings) In celebrating the festival the
    Jews were accustomed to construct booths of the leafy branches of
    trees, -- either on the roofs or in the courts of their dwellings,
    or in the streets and squares, and to adorn them with flowers and
    fruits of all kinds -- under which, throughout the period of the
    festival, they feasted and gave themselves up to rejoicing.
