 Felix = "happy"
 1) a Roman procurator of Judea appointed by the emperor Claudius in
    A.D. 53. He ruled the province in a mean, cruel, and profligate
    manner. His period of office was full of troubles and seditions.
    Paul was brought before Felix at Caesarea. He was remanded in
    prison, and kept there two years in hopes of extorting money from
    him. Acts 24:26,27. At the end of that time Porcius Festus was
    appointed to supersede Felix, who, on his return to Rome, was
    accused by the Jews in Caesarea, and would have suffered the
    penalty due to his atrocities had not his brother Pallas prevailed
    with the emperor Nero to spare him. The wife of Felix was
    Drusilla, daughter of Herod Agrippa I., who was his third wife and
    whom he persuaded to leave her husband and marry him.
