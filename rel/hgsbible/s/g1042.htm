    In the Greek was called Lithostrotos, or the pavement of stones,
 as the Syrian version renders it: it is thought to be the room
 Gazith, in which the sanhedrin sat in the temple when they tried
 capital causes; and it was so called, because it was paved with
 smooth, square hewn stones: "it was in the north part; half of it
 was holy, and half of it was common: and it had two doors, one for
 that part which was holy, and another for that part that was common;
 and in that half that was common the sanhedrin sat." So that into
 this part of it, and by this door, Pilate, though a Gentile, might
 enter. This place, in the language of the Jews, who at that time
 spoke Syrian, was Gabbatha, from its height, as it should seem;
 though the Syrian and Persian versions read Gaphiphtha, which
 signifies a fence or enclosure. Mention is made in the Talmud of the
 upper Gab in the mountain of the house; but whether the same with
 this Gabbatha, and whether this is the same with the chamber Gazith,
 is not certain. The Septuagint uses the same word as John here does,
 and calls by the same name the pavement of the temple on which
 Israelites fell and worshipped God. (2 Chr. 7:3) (Gill)

    The Hebrew word for Pavement occurs only once in the Old
 Testament. In 2 Kings 16:17 we read, "King Ahaz cut off the borders
 of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the
 sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon the
 pavement of stones." In Ahaz's case his act was the conclusive token
 of his abject apostasy. So here of Pilate coming down to the
 apostate Jews. In the former case it was a Jewish ruler dominated by
 a Gentile idolater; in the latter, a Gentile idolater dominated by
 Jews who had rejected the Messiah! (AWP John 19:13)
