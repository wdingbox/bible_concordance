 The word for "Pavement" is found nowhere else in the NT, but its
 Hebrew equivalent occurs just once in the OT, and it is evident that
 the Holy Sprit would have us link the two passages together. In 2
 Kings 16:17 we read, "King Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and
 removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the
 brazen oxen that were under it and put it upon a "pavement" of
 stones." In Ahaz's case, his act was the conclusive token of his
 surrender to abject apostasy. So here of Pilate coming down to the
 level of the apostate Jews. In the former case it was a Jewish ruler
 dominated by a Gentile idolater; in the latter, a Gentile idolater,
 dominated by Jews who rejected their Messiah! AWP
